<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I have always had an interest in IT. My uncle who helps programme a service for a hospital in NSW bought me my first PlayStation and later my first laptop. Over the years I got really into IT, with just recently building my own computer. I wanted to make a computer about 3 years ago. I found myself researching into parts and then diving deeper into how they work. I think this really sparked my further interest into IT. I have an interest if finding out how things work. I currently have no experience working with IT. 
</p>

<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I wanted to pursue a subject that could then help me get a job. I came to RMIT as one of my mates did the same IT course and recommended it to me. I also know the University has a good reputation and the online study fitted my work schedule very well. I chose to come to RMIT as I wanted to increase my knowledge of IT as I have a great passion for it. 
</p>

<p>I expect to learn a lot during my studies. I expect to learn the IT that is being used in the world today. I expect to increase my IT knowledge, that will subsequentially help me gain employment in the future. 
</p>



<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job would be an IT infrastructure Engineer. The position is an IT infrastructure Engineer. This means I will be developing and implementing infrastructure technologies solutions and services for Tas Network and its customers. This position is very appealing to me as I think it will be a challenging job, I think its important to have a job that you wont dread going to every day. I think as its challenging I will enjoy myself more. The money is also a bonus, I also think the finding solutions to problems part of the job will be very rewarding.  
</p>

<p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for this job include an understanding of IT solutions and infrastructure. I will also need to know how to apply this understanding into the utility sector. Having a deep understanding of leading technology solutions around the world will also be beneficial. Characteristics such as innovation, self-motivated, adaptability along with good customer and commercial focus are held at high regard. Experience using FlexPod is also required. 
</p>

<p>I currently have no experience or skills, but I am highly self-motivated and I can adapt and innovate. I have a good customer and commercial focus coming from my current job. 
</p>

<p>I plan to obtain an understanding of IT solutions and infrastructure during my study of IT at RMIT. I should also be able to learn how to apply this understanding in the utility sector by researching and using YouTube. YouTube can also help guide me through using FlexPod so I can obtain a good or great understanding of the software used. 
</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test is that my personality type is that of a defender. These results mean that I am sensitive though have excellent analytical abilities. Have reserved good people skills and great social relationships. It’s the way I use my strengths that defines me. These results might influence my behaviour in a team as I may not share my thoughts or ideas, but I may have great ideas and thoughts. When forming a team, I should find a great leader who will ask questions and team members who will let me express my ideas in a comfortable environment. 
</p>
<p>The results of an online learning style test showed that I am an auditory learner, when scoring 40% on auditory, and 30% on both visual and tactile. An auditory learner means I like to learn by listening and I understand and remember things I hear. These results may influence my behaviour in a team. It means that when in a team I may do more listening than talking. When forming a team I should find people that are good speakers and good listeners so it benefits both worlds. When forming a team, I should make sure that I choose people that can use their words wisely and helpfully.
</p>
<p>The results of this personality test show that I am ‘the counsellor’. This means that I am passionate about ideas and dreams, I’m warm caring and approachable. Can understand people, like organization and am tactical helpful and cautious. These results may influence my behaviour in a good way whilst in a team. It will give me more confidence that I am helping, and I am a critical part in the team. When forming a team, I should find people that have some of the same qualities as me. Such as organization, understanding and passionate. 
</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>The project will be creating and implementing face recognition-based ATM systems. This can also come with additional fingerprint scanning for added security. I think this is an important and interesting project as I think the future is heading towards faster and more secure passwords. New phones have already implemented fingerprint and face recognition passwords, to unlock, put in passwords, and pay for products. I think implementing this into atm’s can make transactions, faster and more secure. It can also help with touching less buttons, as many people use ATMs, germs can be passed around easily. Problems that can be seen straight away are people forcing you to stand in front of the atm to rob you. Also, the recognition service not working properly.  
</p>

<p>I think face recognition in ATMs will be interesting and useful. In today’s society people are more and more worried about how secure their passwords and information are. Also people are worried about the germs that are left on ATM’s. According to auspaynet, around there are around 26,000 ATMs and around 941,391 EFTPOS terminals around the country. With facial recognition I think the process can become quicker and more secure. With the growing worry about covid-19 and the increasing worry of sanitation, facial recognition will allow atm’s to have to keypad, allowing the public to only use the touch screen, which can easily be wiped daily. The fingerprint scanner can utilise a self-cleaning option, in where a quick spray from a nozzle above and a quick blow dry from the same nozzle can get rid of germs. According to the Australian Banking Association, the total number of atm withdrawals by debit cards in February 2021 where 33,198,171, and the total value being $8,672,738,102. This shows that a lot of people still use ATMs, and a lot of money gets withdrawal. 
</p>

<p> Features include Facial recognition, Fingerprint scanner and cardless ATM usage. As the ATM will have many security features with the fingerprint scanner and facial recognition, the atm can be used without a card. This means you will feel more secure knowing no one can steal and use your card. Allowing people to leave cards at home, meaning if they lose a purse or wallet, no one will be able to find or use a bank card. Secondly It cleaner, it allows the person to touch less buttons on the atm. This means no germs will be passed around easily, especially now with covid, people are more aware of sanitisation. The no need for a card means ATMs can be used in emergencies, all you need is yourself.
</p>

<p> Fingerprint scanners have multiple features. Fingerprint passwords are very easy to setup, it only takes about 15 seconds for the device to scan your fingerprint. Fingerprint scanners add a layer of security to your account, I think more and more people are becoming worried about hacking and scams these days. Hackers cannot gain a usable copy of your fingerprint, and it is near impossible to duplicate a fingerprint that a scanner will recognise. Fingerprints cannot be shared or duplicated and also cannot be guessed. It is very simple and fast to scan your fingerprint, much quicker than typing in a code, and is more secure. The scanners are also convenient and user friendly.
</p>

<p>Facial recognition is very secure and very easy to setup. Just a few quick photos of your face and the program does the rest. Facial recognition strengthens security. It also reduces touch points on the ATM allowing it to be cleaner to use. Allows you to leave your card at home, and hackers cannot duplicate your face and get it to be recognised. It is very convenient and easy to use, it also is much faster than typing in a code that you may forget.  
</p>

<p> The ATM will also have Self-cleaning features. These include an Ultraviolet C (UVC) light that can kill nearly all harmful viruses and bacteria that may be left on the fingerprint scanner. The light will kill nearly all micro-organisms and the dosage is safe for humans. When the cleaning will take place, it can be visible and there will be an LED warning light to wait for the cleaning procedure to end. The cleaning of the scanner will only take around 30 seconds, allowing the person to use it, get cash out, and when the next person steps up it should be ready to go. According to David Goldman there is a new antimicrobial touch screen glass for ATM’s. These touchscreens will be used and are made with ionic silver. The ionic silver prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from growing. People have grown more concern about germs since the COVID-19 pandemic. With cardless ATM systems that include more security features, with fingerprint and facial recognition, along with self-cleaning features, I think this is the way forward in the future  
</p>

<p> There are many types of fingerprint scanners, optical sensor, ultrasonic sensor and capacitive sensor. We will use the capacitive sensor (this is used on mobile devices). When your finger is on the touch-capacitive surface, electricity will be used to determine your fingerprint. This creates an image based on the electrostatic field. This works by using tiny capacitor array circuits that track the detail of a fingerprint Capturing the pattern of valleys and ridges on your finger (Arrow.com).
</p>

<p>When setting up your facial signature, you will stand in front of a camera that will take multiple photos of your face from different angels. The facial recognition technology will read the geometry of your face and will then use biometrics to map facial features and put it into the system. These facial features include the distance between eyes or the distance from the forehead to the chin. The software can identify around 68 features that are unique to you resulting in your facial signature (Norton.com)
</p>

<p>There will need to a data base designed to hold the information of the user so the fingerprint and facial scanner can match the two. Software will also have to be written to allow for the fingerprint scanner and facial scanner to search the database. The hardware of the scanners should be easy to implement into the atm system. There will also need to be a new interface system on the atm to allow for the security features. The skills to be able to create this software shouldn’t be too hard to find. There are many services that use this technology already and it should be easy to create it for our ATM. 
</p>

<p>The project should be successful. The outcome will be ATM’s all around the country, mainly in highly populated areas and cities. The outcome will be highly more secure ATM’s with very high sanitisation standards. It will allow people to leave their cards at home, have quick, easy and secure access to an ATM and also have a safe experience, with no spread of germs. This development will have a major impact. ATMs can be a major spot for spreading disease and germs, making this a cleaner space will benefit society greatly. The Facial recognition and fingerprint scanner will give people a greater sense of security when using an ATM.
